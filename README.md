The Maneuverable Autonomous Drone for Navigation and Intelligence (MADNI) is an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that is based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology and can be controlled remotely by a human operator who is located on the ground. The MADNI is a cost-effective in-house designed quadcopter UAV drone equipped with computer vision ability, navigation, object detection, facial recognition, and sensing features for measuring temperature, humidity, and rain detection to perform mission-critical activities. Built for the purpose of surveillance, search and rescue and crowd monitoring.

The repository contains the various resources associated with the MADNI research project, including the paper, tutorial, code examples, and demo. It offers a comprehensive understanding of the project's design and development, the hardware and software used, and the methodology applied for performing intelligent activities. Moreover, it serves as a significant resource for researchers in the field of UAVs, Computer Vision, Deep Learning and enthusiasts in artificial intelligence (AI) who are interested in the progress and underlying mechanisms involved in constructing a drone for intelligent mission activities. The growth of MADNI research and the promotion of collaborative learning are both supported by the active request of contributions from the larger community. The goal of an open approach is to create environments which continually expand to build innovative products.
